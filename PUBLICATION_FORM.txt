‚Ä¢ Adds invisible Em Space (U+2003) before property names
‚Ä¢ Works with Text, Boolean, Instance Swap, and Variant properties  
‚Ä¢ Processes components, instances, and component sets
‚Ä¢ Preserves all property values and instance settings

‚ùå WHAT IT DOESN'T TOUCH:
‚Ä¢ Component names
‚Ä¢ Property values
‚Ä¢ Instance configurations

üöÄ HOW TO USE:
1. Select components with properties
2. Run E-EmptySpace plugin  
3. Done! Property names now have invisible spacing

Perfect for design systems where property organization matters. The invisible spacing helps group related properties visually while maintaining full compatibility with existing components and instances.
