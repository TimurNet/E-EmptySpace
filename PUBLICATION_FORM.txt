DESCRIPTION:
E-EmptySpace helps organize component properties by adding invisible Em Space characters to property names. This creates visual spacing in the properties panel without affecting functionality.

What it does:
• Adds invisible Em Space (U+2003) before property names
• Works with Text, Boolean, Instance Swap, and Variant properties  
• Processes components, instances, and component sets
• Preserves all property values and instance settings

What id doesn't touch: 
• Component names
• Property values
• Instance configurations

How to use:
1. Select components with properties
2. Run E-EmptySpace plugin  
3. Done! Property names now have invisible spacing


Perfect for design systems where property organization matters. The invisible spacing helps group related properties visually while maintaining full compatibility with existing components and instances.
